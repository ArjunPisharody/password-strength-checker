# password-strength-checker
This project is a Python script that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria and provides feedback for improvement. It uses regular expressions to check for key components of a strong password, including length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Features
Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
Character Diversity: Checks for at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
Feedback: Provides detailed feedback on how to improve the password if it doesnâ€™t meet the strength criteria.
